Amara is standing in the middle of a street (her knees and lower legs not visible): Her head is tilted ever so slightly to her right, 
and her gaze is looking in front of her. Her right hand is bent upwards at the elbow, and her left hand is resting on her right thigh. 
Over her left shoulder is draped a small sheer chiffon cloth. Her expression is neutral.
