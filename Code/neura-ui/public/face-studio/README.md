# Face Studio Build Output

This folder is populated by the SvelteKit build (`Code/face-studio`).

Run:

```
cd /mnt/d/Cursor/FileOps-AddingDatasetActions/Code/face-studio
npm run build:embed
```

The script copies `dist/*` here so the React dashboard can serve Face Studio at `/face-studio/index.html`. Do not edit files in this directory manually; regenerate them from the Svelte project instead.*** End Patch
